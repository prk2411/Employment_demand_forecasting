            The Canadian market has come along facing two of the most difficult periods when the world was halted by a financial crisis (The Great Recession 2008) and\
            by a global pandemic (The Covid-19 Pandemic 2020).')

            to Covid Pandemic because during the time of Recession the cash cycle had stopped\
            and moving at very slow rates. Not many employees were fired or layed off, but they had major \
            salary cuts as the companies were not ready to roll the money in the chain. Hence it had very small change\
            in the job market, but it took longer time to catch the pace.')

             warehouses, offices, etc. The companies which were majorly dependent on hand labour work suffered the\
            most in the lockdown. There were heavy layoffs in this industries as the production factories and\
            warehouses were closed. The Jobs which were able to transfer their staff to Work from Home, had seen\
            a much less layoffs and run their companies with closed doors. ')
